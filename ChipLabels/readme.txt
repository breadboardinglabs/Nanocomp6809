For Grant Searle's chip labels please see Grants Web site http://www.searle.wales/
Look for "Home-built micros" and the Chip labels are on the HERE link

My Chip Labels are not quite as neat as Grant's but do the job.
I use Scalable Vector Graphics and use the open source InkScape application to edit them.
I then Export them into PDF for printiing.
Feel free to copy and improve them.

The overline is done by using the Unicode "Combining Overline" U+0305
For R/W̅
In Word type R/WU+0305   then ALT X after the 5, this inserts a Unicode 0305 character Combining Overline
You can also use Windows Character Map to find the character and copy it into where you need it.
